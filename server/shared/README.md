# About

This will contain code that is shared between the services.

# Warning

Because this generally is frowned upon in a microservices architecture, is will be a priority to use code from this module sparingly.

# Future Package

Eventually, this might be converted to an npm package so that services can utilize the contents without a direct dependency to this folder.
