# About

This service will act as a gateway for all (?) client API requests. It is built using Node.js, GraphQL, and TypeScript.

This project was inspired by Ben Awad's [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN3n1USn4xlltIGRInnlHtsOdvHIUQFHL). The original project is over two years old, so work has been done to update code as necessary.
